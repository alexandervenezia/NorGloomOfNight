Dreary figures in unfitted suits wander about, trying to look busy without accidentally doing something useful. Your supervisor makes you wait until she finishes signing off on an interdepartmental memo printed in triplicate. </narration> (Click to advance dialogue.)", "“Oh. The stand-in.” <narration>Watery, swamplike eyes assess you. They don’t seem impressed.</narration> “Mike’s on . . . leave. We need you to cover for him. Our colleague Above is wearing out the shredders in Customer Disservice over the delays already. Something about a crown for [color=purple]Pride.[/color] The paperwork from Upper-Middle Management’s here . . . somewhere.”", "    <narration>There are a lot of papers on her desk. This could take a while.</narration>", "<narration>After several long minutes she gives up, sighs, and taps the small golden scale resting on her desk with a long, sharpened fingernail. One side is weighed down by a spoonful of black powder—the weight of your soul, pinning you here in penance.</narration><br>“Oh, blast it all. Make this mess go away and I’ll . . . take a few years off for you. Now go on. Do your job.”")
