A figure sits atop it, observing you</narration>", "[color=#808080]???:[/color]<br>“Who should dare saunter so casually before my radiant throne?”", "<narration>They don’t look amused.</narration>", "[color=#808080]???:[/color]<br>“Do your senses betray you, or have you, too, fallen starstruck by my divine aura? Allow me to aid your return to reality - you stand in the presence of Her Majesty, the Omnipotent and Infallible, sole heir to all that is worthy in the Seven Circles and beyond: [color=purple] Lucille the Magnificent, Grand Imperator of the Circle of Pride![/color]", "[color=purple]Lucille:[/color]<br><narration>She notices the package at your hip.</narration> “Color me shocked that at least one of you useless wretches from upstairs managed to get this here in one piece! Do you have any idea how long your ‘people’ have kept me waiting?”", "[color=purple]Lucille:[/color]<br>“It scarcely matters now, I suppose.” <narration>You remove the talismans and hand her the parcel, watching as she tears the packaging material to shreds.</narration> Now, this is a symbol befitting of my splendour, the great [color=#ba8c1e]Crown of Pride![/color] I must thank you, insignificant one, for bringing this here.”", "[color=purple]Lucille:[/color]<br>“I have coveted the imperial raiments of Heaven ever since I was cast below. I was one of the favourite of that traitorous excuse for a Father while I was there. I still recall the faces of the other angels, seething with jealousy while I so openly excelled at my duties. How pitiful for them…”", "<narration> As the [color=#ba8c1e]Crown[/color] finds its new home atop [color]Lucille’s[/color] head, you feel a weight lift from your spirit. Your animus is freed from its burden.</narration>", "[color=purple]Lucille:[/color]<br>“...I even remember the oh-so-great Lucifer himself grovelling before me, begging me to share with him how I got my holy smite so powerful. Ha, the poor knave almost sobbed as I turned him away! I used that brilliant smite in the battlefields of Canaan, there was even one young profligate who thought he…”", "<narration>The weight of accumulated fatigue begins to take its toll. The room spins around you as you try to keep focus.</narration>", "[color=purple]Lucille:[/color]<br>“...the look on the King’s face as I burst into the throne room, I thought he might wet himself in terror! Then again, one could hardly be blamed for such a slight, coming face to face with an eminence such as I. There was a similar time in Hattusa, where…”", "<narration>Like dropping a brick on an empty set of scales, your eyelids suddenly succumb to the strain.
