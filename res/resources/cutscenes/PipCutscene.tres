It’s . . . a lot bigger than you expected.</narration>", "<narration>A figure approaches from the darkness.</narration>", "[color=red]Pip:[/color]<br>“Oh, hey. Didn’t expect to see you down here. Management moved you over to the hell route, huh?”", "[color=red]Pip:[/color]<br>“Despite what you may have heard, it’s really not that bad down here. Just watch your step, don’t make eye contact with any of the locals, and don’t be late for your delivery slot. Otherwise, well . . . probably best not to put too many gruesome thoughts in your head which could distract you from your work.”", "[color=red]Pip:[/color]<br><narration>His eyes move across your body, eventually meeting the package by your side.</narration> “Oooh, is that [color=#ba8c1e]Pride’s Crown?[/color] I’ve heard the big guys upstairs losing their sanity over this. Better be extra careful, in that case - that thing is literally worth its weight in gold to the company.”", "<narration>You glance down at the package, littered with talismans. It feels like it’s tugging on your mind and body. There’s a mass in your chest that feels like a lead weight has appeared there.</narration> ", "[color=red]Pip:[/color]<br>“If you wanna deliver that thing safely, you’re gonna have to watch out for the Demons within. Fallen angels, disgraced archons; they’d eat you alive just to have something to gloat about to their peers.”", "[color=red]Pip:[/color]<br>“Try to avoid them if possible, but always keep your wits about you in case you run into one by mistake.”", "[color=red]Pip:[/color]<br>“There’s been a new addition to the chorus of screams and yelling, recently. I’ve been hearing this weird, deep growling sound whenever I’ve been doing rounds recently. So just stay extra on your toes when moving through the castle, OK?”", "[color=red]Pip:[/color]<br><narration>Pip jolts, as if suddenly remembering something.</narration> “Ah, sorry, I really have to go. If I don’t clock back in at HQ on time, they’ll deduct my pay again. If you make it back with your soul intact, maybe we can grab a bite in the cafeteria later?”", "[color=red]Pip:[/color]<br>“All the best, and remember: watch out for whatever is making that growling noise.”")
